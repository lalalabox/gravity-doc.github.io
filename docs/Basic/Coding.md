![select](../images/Basic/jupyterhub-start-server.gif)

configure resource you want

![input](../images/Basic/jupyter_select.png)

### Start kernel

we provide some kernels, installed many useful packages 🎉

- *Python2.7 (sys)* (`/opt/conda/conda-4.12.0/envs/python2`)
- *Python3.7 (sys)* (`/opt/conda/conda-4.12.0/envs/python3`)
- *Julia (sys)*
- *R (sys)*

![kernels](../images/Basic/jupyterhub-kernel.png)

You have no permission to install new package in system kernels.
So, if there is **no package** you want or you want to **create your own kernel**, do as following:

### Create new environment/kernel

load anaconda

```bash
module load anaconda/conda-4.12.0 && source activate
```

create a new environment

```bash
conda create -n myenv  
# or use mamba, it's much faster ⚡⚡⚡
mamba create -n myenv
```

activate your own environment, here named `myenv`

```bash
conda activate myenv
```

install packages you want, here we install `camb` and `ipykernel`

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge camb ipykernel
# or use mamba, it's much faster ⚡⚡⚡ 
mamba install -c conda-forge camb ipykernel
```

install ipykernel (so that we can use this environment/kernel in *Jupyter*)

```bash
python -m ipykernel install --user --name myenv 
```

Now, refresh your *Jupyter*, and you can see your newly configured kernel. Select it for your notebook. enjoy 🎉

> [!TIP]
>   The kernel name is also displayed in the top right corner of your notebook. To see the exact path for this environment:
>   `import sys`   
>   `sys.executable`   
>   This will show the path of the python executable for the current notebook.
> 

### Clone environment/kernel

If you wanna clone an existing environment, you can do as following:   
For example, we wanna clone *Python3.7 (sys)* (`/opt/conda/conda-4.12.0/envs/python3`) to `myenv`   

```bash
# load anaconda
module load anaconda/conda-4.12.0 && source activate

# clone environment
conda create -n myenv --clone /opt/conda/conda-4.12.0/envs/python3
# or use mamba, it's much faster ⚡⚡⚡
mamba create -n myenv --clone /opt/conda/conda-4.12.0/envs/python3

# activate environment
conda activate myenv

# install ipykernel
python -m ipykernel install --user --name myenv 
```

Now, refresh your *Jupyter*, and you can see your newly configured kernel. Select it for your notebook. enjoy 🎉

### Set environment variables

If your package needs some environment variables, like `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, you need to edit the `kernel.json` file.   
For example🌰, we wanna set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/lalala/mylib:/home/.local/fftw/lib` and `module load gsl/2.5` for `myenv` environment/kernel   

First, we need to create a `helper_myenv.sh` script, which will be called by `kernel.json`.

```bash
# create a script and give it execution permission
touch ~/.local/helper_myenv.sh && chmod +x ~/.local/helper_myenv.sh
# edit it with vim
vim ~/.local/helper_myenv.sh
```

copy the following code to `helper_myenv.sh`, and save it

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# activate module command
source /etc/profile.d/modules.sh

# load what you need or change environment variable
module load gsl/2.5

# set environment variable
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/lalala/mylib:/home/.local/fftw/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

# go on ... (start ipython) DO NOT delete the last line!!!
exec "$@"
```

Next, we need to call this script in `~/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/myenv/kernel.json`, we **only need** to add one line below `"argv": [`.  Remember to use **absolute path** of `helper_myenv.sh`!


This is the original `kernel.json` file👇

```json
{
 "display_name": "myenv", 
 "language": "python", 
 "argv": [
  "/home/lalala/.conda/envs/myenv/bin/python",
  "-m", 
  "ipykernel_launcher", 
  "-f", 
  "{connection_file}"
 ]
}
```

This is the modified `kernel.json` file👇

```json
{
 "display_name": "myenv", 
 "language": "python", 
 "argv": [
  "/home/lalala/.local/helper_myenv.sh",
  "/home/lalala/.conda/envs/myenv/bin/python",
  "-m", 
  "ipykernel_launcher", 
  "-f", 
  "{connection_file}"
 ]
}
```

Now, refresh your *Jupyter*, and your `myenv` kernel will have the environment variables you set. enjoy 🎉

### Shutdown Jupyter

- If you want to close it **temporarily**, hoping it is still running background on *Gravity*, just **close your browser**.

- If you want to shutdown it **permanently**, click **File -> Hub Control Panel -> Stop My server**

![image-20210730120718970](../images/Basic/jupyterhub-close1.png)

![image-20210730120814518](../images/Basic/jupyterhub-close2.png)

### Classic Notebook (old but fast)

If you prefer the **traditional jupyter-notebook**, it is faster than *JupyterLab*.

![classic notebook](../images/Basic/jupyterhub-classic-notebook.png)

### Retrolab

*retrolab* is **Retro Style** of *JupyterLab*, it is faster than *Jupyterlab* 

![Retrolab](../images/Basic/jupyterhub-retrolab1.png)

It maintains most of properties of *Jupyterlab*. more like a modern *Jupyter-notebook*.

![Retrolab](../images/Basic/jupyterhub-retrolab2.png)

### Drag

You can drag the sub-window to reorganize your workspace like this

![image-20210730121419726](../images/Basic/jupyterhub-drag.png)

Even more, you can drag the unit block of the notebook to another notebook or a console.   

You can open python console combined with the notebook/text file (it's helpful when you wanna temporarily test or debug)   

> - In notebook, you can drag the unit block between notebook and console
> - In text file, you can use **Shift + Enter** to run the code in the console. Also , you can drag code from console.


![image-20210730121846980](../images/Basic/jupyterhub-console.png)

![image-20210730133917039](../images/Basic/jupyterhub-console-text.png)

### Data Transfer

If your need to download/upload files from/to *Gravity*, there is an easiest way that you just need to **drag** whatever you need into/out the Jupyterlab.

> PS. If your files are pretty large (eg. >10GB), you'd better use `scp, rsync` or other tools.

### Markdown

At *Launcher*, you can double click *Markdown file*, then right click to select **Show Markdown Preview** like this

![image-20210730141653276](../images/Basic/jupyterhub-markdown.png)

### Python Documentation

If you are not familiar with some function or package, you can try to use **Show Contextual Help** in *Launcher*. You just need to click the function, and the **Help** (**documentation**) will display instantly!

![image-20210730142333335](../images/Basic/jupyterhub-help.png)

### Diagram

You can click the **Diagram** at *launcher* to draw a flowchart

![open a diagram](../images/Basic/jupyter-diagram-open.png)

There are many templates

![image-20210730143446883](../images/Basic/jupyterhub-flowchart.png)

### Visual Python

[*visualpython*](https://visualpython.ai/) is a **Python code generator**. You just need to click some buttons to generate codes you want, such as data visualization, machine learning etc. ([*GIF example*](https://gravity.sjtu.edu.cn/file/api/public/dl/bjEJwMgn/image_video/Visual_Python_2.2.8.gif?inline=true))   
Because it **only** supports **Classic notebook** for now, we need to open *Classic* in *Jupyterlab*   

![open-classic](../images/Basic/jupyter-classic-open.png)

Click the orange button at top

![open-visualpython](../images/Basic/jupyter-visual-open.png)

Enjoy coding 🥳

### Git

From the sidebar, you can find a [Git extension](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-git).

- You can use it clone, pull, push, etc.
- You can use *diff* in the notebook to check what changes you've made.
- You can use it on *Login nodes* and *Computing nodes*

![git GIF](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-git/master/docs/figs/preview.gif)

For example🌰, I wanna clone the `pyccl` repo

```link
https://github.com/LSSTDESC/CCL
```

Click the *Git* button → *Clone a Repository*

![git](../images/Basic/git-clone.png)

Input the link `https://github.com/LSSTDESC/CCL.git`

![git](../images/Basic/git-input.png)

Success!!!

![git open](../images/Basic/git-open.png)

### Resource Monitor

From sidebar, you can find a **GPU dashboard** button

![monitor button](../images/Basic/jupyter-resource.png)

You can monitor the **real-time**  resource usage

![monitor view](../images/Basic/monitor-resource.png)

### HDF5 Viewer

You can open and explore **HDF5 files** in JupyterLab.

Here is a `hdf5` file, you can click on it

![hdf5 file](../images/Basic/hdf5-file.png)

Then you will see this panel, showing the data

![hdf5 open](../images/Basic/hdf5-select.png)

You can explore the data, and even **filter** it!

![hdf5 filter](../images/Basic/hdf5-view.png)

### Variable Inspector

You can **right-click** your notebook, select `Open Variable Inspector`

![variable open](../images/Basic/variable-click.png)

It will open a sub-window showing current variables

![variable view](../images/Basic/variable-view.png)

### TAB Selection

when coding, you can use `<TAB>` to view the sub-function, and

- `<Shift>+<TAB>` upside
- `<TAB>` downside

![tab](../images/Basic/tab.png)

### Text Coding

Open/create a text file `*.py`

![py-create](../images/Basic/python-txt-open.png)

Connect text file with a *kernel* (you can even connect a running *kernel*)
**`right click`** → **Create Console for Editor**

![py-open](../images/Basic/python-txt-click.png)

Now, this text file is more like a *notebook*.
Use **`<Shift+Enter>`** to run code selected

![py-run](../images/Basic/python-txt-run.png)

Use **`<TAB>`** to select *sub-function* etc.

![py-select](../images/Basic/python-txt-tab.png)

### Adjust Sidebar

If you feel the sidebar has too many icons, **DO NOT worry**, let's change their place!
You can *right-click* the icon on the sidebar → *switch*, it will go to the right-side!

![sidebar](../images/Basic/jupyter-sidebar.png)

### Chinese

You can also change the language to Chinese(中文)

![chinese](../images/Basic/chinese.png)

## VScode (web)

As is well-known, *VScode* is the best editor for coding in the world 😜

> 1. 💪 thousands of extensions available
> 2. ⚡ much **faster** than Jupyter
> 3. 💯 support C/C++, Fortran, R, Go, Julia, Python etc.
> 4. 😎 install any extension you like, **customize** your own vscode!

> [!TIP]
>  **Only if** you stop the server from JupyterHub, can the VScode really stop.
>  It's better to use **Chrome** or **Edge** rather than ~~Firefox~~.
> 

### Start

Start a *Jupyter Server*, click the *VScode* button

![image-20210730145322829](../images/Basic/jupyterhub-vscode-click.png)

Coding, no matter you perfer C/C++ or Julia or other language, it's easy to use

![image-20210730145603882](../images/Basic/jupyterhub-vscode-coding.png)

Also, it **supports** *jupyter-notebook*

![image-20210730145653821](../images/Basic/jupyterhub-vscode-notebook.png)

### Install Extensions

You can click *extension* button on the left, then **search** and **install** any *extension* you like! 😊

![search-extension](../images/Basic/vscode-extension-search.png)

If you cannot find the extension you want, you can download the `vsix` file from [*marketplace*](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/), then install it manually.

For example, we wanna install the *copilot* extension, use **`Ctrl+Shift+P`** to open the command panel, then type **`vsix`**, press `Enter`

![search-vsix](../images/Basic/vscode-extension-search-vsix.png)

We have downloaded some useful (I guess🥰) extensions at `/opt/tools/vscode-extensions`:

> - Black Formatter
> - Cmake Tools
> - Dracula Theme
> - Gather
> - Python
> - Pylance
> - Jupyter
> - Jupyter Powertoys
> - GitLens
> - Git Graph
> - VScode Great Icons
> - Code Runner
> - chatGPT中文版
> - Github Copilot
> - Github Copilot Labs
> - Markdown All in One
> - YAML
> - VScode 中文语言包

so we just enter this path: `/opt/tools/vscode-extensions`, select *copilot* or anything you like.

![vscode-install-vsix](../images/Basic/vscode-extension-vsix-install.png)

Now, enjoy your coding 🥳

## VScode (remote)

If you wanna use *VScode* on your own computer, you can use **remote** mode. So you can run your code on *Gravity*.

### Install

You need to install [*Remote Development*](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack) extension first.

![vscode remote install](../images/Basic/vscode-remote-install.png)

### Configure

We need to configure the *SSH* connection. Click the *Remote Explorer* button on the left, then click the *SSH TARGETS* button on the top. Click setting ⚙️, open `~/.ssh/config` file.

![vscode remote setting](../images/Basic/vscode-remote-setting.png)

Edit the `~/.ssh/config` file, add the following content. Remember to change the `User` and `IdentityFile` to your own *Gravity* account. If you want to connect *computing nodes*, remember to change `HostName` to your appllied computing node.

```bash
# Gravity login node (backup)
Host login01
    HostName login01.gravity.sjtu.edu.cn
    User your_username
    Port 22
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_Gravity

# Gravity login node (main)
Host login02
    HostName gravity.sjtu.edu.cn
    User your_username
    Port 22
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_Gravity

# Gravity computing node, jump from login02
Host computing
    HostName gr11
    User your_username
    Port 22
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_Gravity
    ProxyJump login02
```

After saving the file, refresh the *Remote Explorer* page, you will see the *Gravity* connection.

### Connect

Click *SSH TARGETS* button, then click *login02* or *login01* or *computing*, enjoy your coding 🥳

![vscode remote connect](../images/Basic/vscode-remote-connect.png)

## PyCharm (remote)

> [!TIP]
> **PyCharm** is a powerful IDE for Python. The professional version also supports **remote** mode. So you can run your code on *Gravity*.   
> Setting is similar to *VScode (remote)*, you can refer to it.
>
